### Technical Notes
* **Transverse Abdominis Activation:** Prioritize drawing the navel toward the spine during all movements to ensure deep core engagement.
* **Spinal Alignment:** Avoid hyperextension of the neck; keep the gaze neutral to the floor during planks and bird-dogs.
* **Frequency:** For optimal physiological adaptation, perform this routine 3–4 times per week with at least 24 hours of recovery between sessions.
