# Philmont Crew 618 Training & Fitness Guide

## Purpose of This Guide

This comprehensive training and fitness guide is designed to prepare Crew 618 members for the physical demands of their June 2026 Philmont expedition. Philmont is not like your local Scout camp—the stamina required to hike Philmont is significantly greater due to the distances traveled (50-100+ miles over 10-12 days), elevation changes (6,500 to 12,441 feet), and the overall duration of the trek.

**Training Completion Deadline: June 11, 2026** (one week before our June 18, 2026 arrival at Philmont)

---

## Understanding the Philmont Challenge

Before diving into training programs, it's essential to understand exactly what you're preparing for:

### Physical Demands
- **Elevation**: Philmont ranges from 6,500 to 12,441 feet. At these altitudes, there is 20-35% less oxygen than at sea level.
- **Pack Weight**: You'll carry a backpack weighing up to 1/3 of your body weight (typically 35-50 lbs).
- **Terrain**: Expect steep, rocky trails with 1,000+ foot climbs on a typical day.
- **Daily Distance**: Most days involve 5-12 miles of hiking over challenging terrain.
- **Duration**: Your body must sustain this effort for 10-12 consecutive days.

### Why Training Matters
According to Philmont's official guidance, *"A program of regular aerobic exercise that begins six months or more before you come to Philmont is highly recommended."* This guide starts your training **6+ months** before your arrival, giving you ample time to build the endurance, strength, and mental toughness needed for success.

# Choosing Your Training Path

This guide offers **three distinct training tracks** to accommodate different starting fitness levels, goals, and access to equipment. Choose the path that best fits your situation:

| Track | Best For | Equipment Needed | Time Commitment |
|-------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Path A: Home-Based Beginner** | Those new to fitness or with limited equipment | Minimal: stairs, backpack, basic weights optional | 30-45 min, 4x/week |
| **Path B: Home/Gym Intermediate** | Active individuals wanting a balanced program | Moderate: access to gym OR good home equipment | 45-60 min, 4-5x/week |
| **Path C: Gym-Based Advanced** | Experienced fitness enthusiasts | Full gym access with cardio and weight equipment | 60-90 min, 5-6x/week |

**Important**: You can switch between paths as your fitness improves or as your access to equipment changes.

# Special Considerations: Youth vs. Adults

Training for Philmont differs significantly between youth (ages 13-20) and adults (21+). Both groups must be prepared, but the approach should be tailored to each.

## Youth Considerations (Ages 13-20)

### Physiological Differences
- **Growth Plates**: Youth still have open growth plates in their bones. Heavy weight training with maximum loads is NOT recommended.
- **Recovery**: Young bodies generally recover faster than adult bodies, allowing for more frequent training sessions.
- **Flexibility**: Youth typically have better natural flexibility but may neglect stretching—don't skip it!
- **Cardiovascular Adaptation**: Young hearts and lungs adapt quickly to aerobic training.

### Youth Training Guidelines
- **Focus on bodyweight exercises** rather than heavy weight training
- **Emphasize proper form** over intensity—bad habits now can lead to injuries later
- **Limit weight training** to moderate loads (can perform 12-15 repetitions with good form)
- **Prioritize hiking practice** with gradually increasing pack weight
- **Stay active daily**—youth benefit from variety (soccer, basketball, swimming in addition to hiking)
- **Parents/Guardians**: Monitor for overtraining signs like persistent fatigue, declining performance, or mood changes

### Pack Weight Guidelines for Youth
| Age Range | Starting Pack (% body weight) | Goal Pack (% body weight) |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 13-14 | 10-15% | 20-25% |
| 15-17 | 15-20% | 25-30% |
| 18-20 | 20% | 30-33% |

## Adult Considerations (Ages 21+)

### Physiological Differences
- **Recovery Time**: Adults require more recovery time between intense sessions (48-72 hours for muscle groups).
- **Injury Risk**: Joint and soft tissue injuries are more common—proper warm-up and stretching are essential.
- **Cardiovascular Baseline**: Adults over 40 should consult a physician before beginning any exercise program.
- **Chronic Conditions**: Many adults have pre-existing conditions (bad knees, back issues) that require modified exercises.

### Adult Training Guidelines
- **Start conservatively** and build gradually over the 6-month period
- **Prioritize injury prevention**—warm up thoroughly and don't skip rest days
- **Include flexibility/mobility work** in every session
- **Consider cross-training** to reduce repetitive stress injuries
- **Listen to your body**—pain is a signal to stop, not push through
- **Consult healthcare providers** if you have chronic conditions or are over 40

### Medical Clearance Reminder
Adults over 40 or those with known health conditions should obtain medical clearance before beginning this program. The Philmont Annual Health and Medical Record (AHMR) requires a physician's signature anyway, so schedule that appointment early!

# Addressing Unique Challenges and Limitations

Not everyone starts from the same place. This section provides modifications for common challenges.

## Challenge: Knee Issues

**Modifications**:
- Replace lunges with **split squats with rear foot elevated** (less knee stress)
- Use a **shallower squat depth** (to a box or chair)
- Emphasize **glute strengthening** (bridges, clamshells) to take pressure off knees
- **Pool walking or swimming** for cardio (low impact)
- Consider **knee sleeves** for added support during hiking
- **Strengthen VMO** (inner quad) with terminal knee extensions

**Important Exercises**:
> 📹 **Video Demo**: [Exercises for Bad Knees - Athlean-X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvlMW_qLHbM)

## Challenge: Back Pain or Issues

**Modifications**:
- **Prioritize core stability** exercises (dead bugs, bird dogs, Pallof press)
- Avoid heavy spinal loading (no heavy back squats; use leg press instead)
- **Hip hinge training** with perfect form (start with dowel rod, then add weight gradually)
- **Stretching hip flexors** to reduce anterior pelvic tilt
- **McGill Big 3** exercises daily:
  1. Curl-up (NOT a crunch)
  2. Side plank
  3. Bird dog
> 📹 **Video Demo**: [McGill Big 3 - Squat University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_e4I-brfqs)

## Challenge: Limited Cardiovascular Fitness

# Essential Stretching and Mobility Routine

Stretching is not optional—it's essential for injury prevention and recovery. Complete this routine after every workout and on rest days.

## Post-Workout Stretching Routine (10-15 minutes)

Hold each stretch for 30-60 seconds. Breathe deeply.

# Nutrition for Training and Trek

Proper nutrition supports your training and prepares you for trail food.

## Training Nutrition Guidelines

### Hydration
- **Daily Goal**: Half your body weight in ounces of water (150 lb person = 75 oz)
- **During Exercise**: 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes
- **Electrolytes**: Add to water during longer sessions or hot weather

### Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)
- Complex carbs (oatmeal, whole grain bread, banana)
- Moderate protein
- Low fat (slower to digest)

### Post-Workout (within 30-60 minutes)
- Protein for muscle repair (20-40 grams)
- Carbs to replenish glycogen
- Examples: Protein shake, chocolate milk, turkey sandwich

### General Training Diet
- **Carbohydrates**: 45-55% of calories (fuel for hiking)
- **Protein**: 20-25% of calories (muscle repair and building)
- **Fat**: 25-30% of calories (endurance energy)

## Preparing for Trail Food

Practice eating foods similar to what you'll eat at Philmont:
- Dehydrated meals
- Trail mix and dried fruit
- Peanut butter and tortillas
- Energy bars
- Instant oatmeal
- Electrolyte drink mixes

**Important**: Test foods during training hikes. Discover what your body tolerates well BEFORE you're on the trail!

# Mental Preparation

Physical training is only part of the equation. Mental toughness separates successful crews from struggling ones.

## Building Mental Resilience

**1. Embrace Discomfort**
- During training, practice being uncomfortable (continue exercising when tired)
- Learn the difference between "pain" (stop) and "discomfort" (push through)

**2. Visualize Success**
- Spend 5-10 minutes daily visualizing completing trail sections
- Picture yourself at the top of Baldy Mountain or the Tooth of Time

**3. Practice Positive Self-Talk**
- Replace "I can't" with "I haven't yet"
- Celebrate small victories during training

**4. Develop a Mantra**
- Create a short phrase for tough moments: "One step at a time" or "I trained for this"

**5. Team Mindset**
- Remember: This is a crew effort, not an individual challenge
- Plan to support crew members who may struggle
- "Everyone finishes together"

# Crew Training Activities

Training together builds both fitness and team cohesion.
